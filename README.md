# Is it always bad and how archiving it helps us understand the past?

# THE ARTEFACT

In the archive, at IISH, I was mostly drawn to objects and collections concerning women. Among them, I found pieces from USSR and made them my research focus. Below you'll find a full list of objects I looked at and some that I marked as interesting.

I put them here not to simply do so but also because looking at them made it clearer for me what I want to work with. Also they are a nice reference list. 

### All of the objects I saw in the archive

[Things I saw in the archive](https://www.notion.so/e0a7c1c16016455da150344fed87070a)

As the list is chronological it also shows how I got better with using the archive's codes and how searching became easier. Many things are also references from previously read books and artefacts from the archive.

### The object I picked for my transcoding - "Mother and Child Care in the USSR" O.P. Nogina (book)

![https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/81/84/c881846cbbcda531815828d64993a6a4.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/81/84/c881846cbbcda531815828d64993a6a4.jpg)

*Book summary:*</br>
*→ women are equal to men (by revolution!)*</br>
*→ raising children and childcare are a common effort*</br>
*→ having or not having children is a free choice*</br>

The entire book in high quality pictures.

# IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND TERMS

Captive Wife is a term from 60'-70' describing women that were encouraged to be stay at home mums and housewives. It was part of the after war propaganda in the west. After was and many lives lost more children were needed ad a future insurance. Also men that came back from war needed a goal in life therefore there was a need to give them jobs to keep them thinking only about that. Women were occupying a lot of that positions therefore it was decided that they should focus on having children and free the occupations.

A few male-made ideas for females destroyed by other males → about the book

 Production of contemporary Captive Wives

 Is propaganda always bad?

 Why?

If this book and its contents was so important for the USSR to be translated, printed and sent to other countries wouldn't it be important to keep it spread an accessible. If it was so crucial to share it should be shared and shared and shared. Quite mindlessly. That's why I want to explore the most mass, accessible and easiest to reconstruct methods. 
Another challenge is how to make it accessible to masses in the future? 
Because I am sure it will survive if spread so greatly.

# TRANSCODING(s)

## Strategy

It would be easier to focus on a selected situation and then think about sub-scenarios and develop accordingly.

### Strategy 1

ABILITY TO REPRODUCE CONTENT:

A. matters:

1. and it needs to be reproduced or kept exactly as it is.
2. and it needs to be reproduced or kept exactly how it is with all its physical qualities. 
3. and it doesn't need to be reproduced or kept exactly how it is.
4. and it doesn't need to be reproduced or kept exactly how it is with all its physical qualities.

B. does not matter so much:

1. and it can be reproduced exactly.
2. and it just needs to give you an idea.
3. and it just needs to give you a notion.
4. and it just needs to make you think of the subject.

C. does not matter at all:

1. what matters is exactly recreating physical aspects of the book.
2. what matters is exactly recreating physical experience of the book.

### Strategy 2

REPRODUCTION IS FOUND, not made:

1. reproductions I found (made by others)
2. reprint of the same book
3. translation

### Strategy 3

VISUAL REPRODUCTION is what matters:

1. exact visual reproduction.
2. subjective visual reproduction.

## Focus

Focus on two approaches; mass and minimum production.

Meaningless mass reproduction of worthless, mostly unfulfilled, and false ideas.

What is the relation between propaganda and an institution of an archive?

How "usable" the archive itself is?

Is keeping really the mean of saving - subjectivity of language as a medium.

## My small transcodings:

- First steps with OCR

    [Optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)

    I found a pdf of the book online:

    [GIPE-111035.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDBs3_eN2_GziyJkQUsiF71B0FSbXxCN/view?usp=drivesdk)

    The quality wasn't the best but that was already something as I wanted to try to get the content of the book without typing it in myself.

    [https://youtu.be/JwmHxxuh4BQ](https://youtu.be/JwmHxxuh4BQ)

    Unfortunately, it didn't work at all.

    Next I decided to use Google Translate on my phone and the result was way better. I used pictures of the book I took at the archive and put the through the Google Translate OCR.

    The result of this:

    [Mother and Child care content from google translate image.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pa1P62HSe3Wb-a6sWDhzOYp_4VTDl8JY/view?usp=drivesdk)

    Notes: The result is very much imperfect, has many typos or in general the OCR didn't recognize the characters correctly. 
    Is it still a good transcoding?

    I saved the outcome as a google doc and used my grammar app to fix the mistakes that were left.

    The end result:

    [Mother and Child Care content fixed with grammar check.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1svfHp_8CnV92JejIlhMe1i4pLXmjBQN8/view?usp=drivesdk)

    Note: the Grammarly sometimes doesn't change the words to the correct ones and obscures the true meaning.

    After that I decided to work with another OCR or find out how to write a code for one.

- Using Adobe OCR

    So I took again the terrible pdf I found online:

    [GIPE-111035-Contents.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BfoqhKbyWG4a4KW2gTPIcfOQ_2lZyc5g/view?usp=drivesdk)

    And I used Adobe Acrobat's OCR to try to get it to look better and maybe to get better character recognition. 

    [pdf processed by adobe acrobat.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WQpFj5rKBAa3x8qtwv1vF62vr11sPpOh/view?usp=drivesdk)

    It worked way better but still there were some obscurities and some weird spacing and signs it added by itself.

    Note: The result is much better than the Google Translate, yet, I will try to fins something better.

- My own OCR - Tesseract

    I found an instruction how to make use of the Tesseract OCR (Windows specific) and followed it to use the code on my own PC.

    [A gentle introduction to OCR](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-ocr-ee1469a201aa)

    ![https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9f/5b/b1/9f5bb1efe9d12a3ea871fd14e8e72232.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9f/5b/b1/9f5bb1efe9d12a3ea871fd14e8e72232.jpg)

    That went pretty ok. The only challenging part is that each page of pdf had to be converted to jpg in order to do that.

    I did that and the end result is a .txt file.

    ![https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2e/b4/bc/2eb4bc45fba870baed2ac793c12d5266.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2e/b4/bc/2eb4bc45fba870baed2ac793c12d5266.jpg)

    Note: the result is the best so far. The minimal editing of text is kept which is good too (paragraphs). In the end - happy with the result.

- Translating to different languages

    I also tried translating me newly acquired better pdf to see if there are more obscurities because of using yet another software on the source text. 

    I translated to Russian

    [Mother and Child from acrobat file google ranslated to Russian Cyryllic.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7-t1KYATMqZ0ydvdazhIpwj-nc7NGMU/view?usp=drivesdk)

    And to Polish

    [Mother and Child from acrobat file google ranslated to Polish.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exhU1yZCjEsDu5Ns-S_vM-udKfb3YQIS/view?usp=drivesdk)

    I don't think that really did help me much with the project overall... But it's another proof of how subjective the understanding of language is and also how subjective the translation can be.

- Only pure text and it's placement matters

    This attempt only saves content as text bus disregards all visual things.

    [Instruction for reproduction - content matters.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KLYmelR6oWzeu_STG6zbIprsMv9yPLYo/view?usp=drivesdk)

    Note: How much information is saved for the future depends on who and how is describing it.

- Visual matters too

    Not only text as a content but also visual appearance of it matters. Yet, described by words might come out differently by each reproduction attempt.

    [instruction for reproduction - content matters - visuals matters too.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EkZwkuWKBexJAC0f79EEAV2V2vfT8MNM/view?usp=drivesdk)

    Note: but still level of detail in describing can be different.

- Visual matters but how much?

    Now I gave a more specific descriptions of, not only the text, but also visual.

    In the end I think it makes it even more subjective on how to reproduce it.
    Still, I could be even more precise or use more objective terms. Like: I'm assuming she's a mother.

## Bigger, but not yet final, transcodings:

- From description of an image to a new image

    ![https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/53/65/c25365a4d8fc81935de4aca2f93bec37.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/53/65/c25365a4d8fc81935de4aca2f93bec37.jpg)

    Descriptions:

    1. Two women standing above a wooden construction made of posts. In the construction 4 children.
    2. Two women, one doctor the other a nurse bending towards 4 children in the playpen. Windows and plants in the background.
    3. Two women, one doctor the other a nurse bending towards 4 children in the hencoop.

    I googled the descriptions:

    Maybe I should only google the keywords...

    Two women standing above a wooden construction made of posts. In the construction 4 children.

    Two women standing wooden construction posts 4 children

    Note: It would be nice to have a code to do it. Maybe even collage it.
    It proofs yet again how subjective medium language is in keeping the information.

# Plan for the final result

I believe that it is hard to judge all of the propaganda in the world, history. But I decided that I have an opinion about this propaganda. I think that for this assignment I want to focus on the fact how mindlessly was this shared and the fact that it was UNTRUTH. This book seems to be mere ideas of the author rather than a statement of facts, nevertheless, it was shared and used as a marketing tool of the state. Funny enough the author was prosecuted by the state before for having and spreading the ideas.

## Game with 3 levels that symbolise:

- Empty promise of propaganda
- Language as a subjective form of safekeeping information
- A monument of an object - inaccessible and dead

## Process pictures and videos:

The adjusted 3D models I want to use in the game visualisation of the 3 levels. I rigged the roughly and added animation pre-sets I found in Adobe Mixamo.

Work on the end result continues...
