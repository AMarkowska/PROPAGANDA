|![cover of the book](/media/covercover.jpg)| In the picture, you can see the cover of the book. It's a photomontage of a woman holding a child. The baby is out of proportion and you can see an uneven transition between cutouts of woman and the child. In the background, there is a blooming tree. The title on the cover is in English.

## Research about the Object

### Book summary
*→ women are equal to men (by revolution!)*
*→ raising children and childcare are a common effort*
*→ having or not having children is a free choice*

### About the publishing house
    The book was published as a piece of propaganda targeted at the Western population.</br>
   [Foreign Languages Publishing House Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Languages_Publishing_House_(Soviet_Union))

   The sole purpose of FLPH in the USSR (there are/were more establishment's called similarly in all communist countries) was to publish works of Soviet propaganda, often works of Lenin and Stalin.

   The fact that this book got published is quite curious because the author wasn't always in line with the state's propaganda. From what I researched it seems it's because she turned her ideas into a pretty, but untrue picture and claimed that Lenin himself wanted her to spread that vision. That argument has no proof but probably made the book pass the censorship because it would work well as propaganda targeted at the West.

### About the author of the book
The first thing I found out that the O.P. stands for Olga Pavlovna which suggested that the author was a woman. After that, the research became easier as more sources came up in the google search typing in her name in both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.
[Nogina, O. P. (Olʹga Pavlovna) 1885-1977](http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n2012183966/)
[Found this Wikipedia entry in Cyrillic but it google translates pretty ok. Also, I checked later with my mother who can read it.](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0,_%D0%9E%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B3%D0%B0_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0)

Her name was Ногина, Ольга Павловна in Cyrillic. She lived from 1885 till 1977. She was a Soviet pediatrician. Also, became an Honoured Doctor of RSFSR (Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) and was a prime organizer of Soviet Health Care.

During and after revolution she worked with group of Bolsheviks led by V.I. Lenin. In 1934 - Head of the Department for the Protection of Maternity and Infancy of the People's Commissariat of Health.

Later in 50', she was the head of the maternity and infancy protection department of the health department of the Khamovnichesky district of Moscow, which helped her reorganize health care. At that time she wrote many papers on how to revolutionize that sector. That made her a focus on unwanted attention from Stalin and the party. She suffered many mistreatments because of that and many of her works got blocked by the department of censorship.

Nevertheless, she worked on the creation of a network of women's and children's health care facilities, in training personnel, and in promoting Soviet health care and wrote around 30 books on and around the subject of health and wellbeing.

### Where can you find this book outside of the archive?
This book is surprisingly wide spread. I found it in several libraries.</br></br>

[Mother and child care in the USSR / O.P. Nogina | National Library of Australia](https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4901770)
[KERALA STATE LIBRARY COUNCIL catalog › Details for: MOTHER AND CHILD CARE IN THE USSR](http://kslc.in/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=85367)</br>
[You can still buy it on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-O-P-Nogina/s?rh=n%3A266239%2Cp_27%3AO+P+Nogina)

The book is often listed with this fake cover. Publishing date suggests that the edition is the same as the one from the archive but then this covers is the image representing the book. Was there something wrong with the old one?

## Important terms and research questions
*Captive Wife* is a term from 60'-70' describing women that were encouraged to be stay at home mums and housewives. It was part of the after war propaganda in the west. After was and many lives lost more children were needed ad a future insurance. Also men that came back from war needed a goal in life therefore there was a need to give them jobs to keep them thinking only about that. Women were occupying a lot of that positions therefore it was decided that they should focus on having children and free the occupations.

*A few male-made ideas for females destroyed by other males* → about the book

 *Production of contemporary Captive Wives*

 Is propaganda always bad?

 *Why?*
If this book and its contents was so important for the USSR to be translated, printed and sent to other countries wouldn't it be important to keep it spread an accessible. If it was so crucial to share it should be shared and shared and shared. Quite mindlessly. That's why I want to explore the most mass, accessible and easiest to reconstruct methods.
Another challenge is how to make it accessible to masses in the future?
Because I am sure it will survive if spread so greatly.

## Transcoding
### Focus of the transcodings:
→ Focus on two approaches; mass and minimum production.
*Meaningless mass reproduction of worthless, mostly unfulfilled, and false ideas.*

→ What is the relation between propaganda and an institution of an archive?

→ How "usable" the archive itself is?

*Is keeping really the mean of saving - subjectivity of language as a medium.*

### Strategy

*It would be easier to focus on a selected situation and then think about sub-scenarios and develop accordingly.*

### Strategy 1

|ABILITY TO REPRODUCE CONTENT:|||
|---|---|---|
| A. matters: |B. does not matter so much:|C. does not matter at all:|
|1. and it needs to be reproduced or kept exactly as it is.|1. and it can be reproduced exactly.|1. what matters is exactly recreating physical aspects of the book.|
|2. and it needs to be reproduced or kept exactly how it is with all its physical qualities. |2. and it just needs to give you an idea.|2. what matters is exactly recreating physical experience of the book.|
|3. and it doesn't need to be reproduced or kept exactly how it is.|3. and it just needs to give you a notion.
|4. and it doesn't need to be reproduced or kept exactly how it is with all its physical qualities.|4. and it just needs to make you think of the subject.

### Strategy 2

|REPRODUCTION IS FOUND, not made:|
|---|
|1. reproductions I found (made by others)|
|2. reprint of the same book|
|3. translation|

### Strategy 3

|VISUAL REPRODUCTION is what matters:|
|---|
|1. exact visual reproduction.|
|2. subjective visual reproduction.|

## Transcoding No. 1
### First steps with OCR
[Optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)

I found a pdf of the book online:
![pdf](/media/pdfscan.jpg)
[GIPE-111035.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDBs3_eN2_GziyJkQUsiF71B0FSbXxCN/view?usp=drivesdk)

I really wanted to be able to work with the clean content of the book but without a need of re-typing it myself. Also, the extraction of content-text would be already a sort of transcoding. Taking the text out of the context of physical objects was one of my first research questions. How much the physical aspects matter? How much information does it convey? Is that information extra or necessary?

I had those questions because in the archive not all objects are accessible for the visitor to experience fully - some are only available for digital viewing. Is the scan the same as a physical copy? No. The original object also has an additional story to it - this particular object got to the archive not only because of being a copy of a specific text but also because of its story as memorabilia.

I like to think that the history of the collected copy matters just as much. Why is it in the archive? Why this copy? And so on...

In the next transcodings, I focus more on stripping that quality from it just to check what happens when I do. Is the "pure text" copy as relevant?

Coming back to the book's pdf I found online the quality wasn't the best but that was already something as I wanted to try to get the content of the book without typing it in myself.

### Methods
I decided to use a range of Optical Character Recognition systems, Softwares, and APIs to achieve my "pure text copy". I started from the most straight forward and proceeded to the more advanced.

### Tools
[In order of use:]()
[Google Translate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate)
[Google Translate OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate)
[Grammarly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammarly)
[Adobe Acrobat built in OCR](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/how-to/ocr-software-convert-pdf-to-text.html)
[Tesseract for Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software))

## Transcoding Tool
### Code for using Tesseract OCR

### Aims
The main reason for using it was to get the "pure text copy" from the book without just simply copying it and to strip the text-content from the surrounding context.
### Methods
The Tesseract OCR runs on C++, but you can also use Python. There were only small changes to the code I found as it's quite straight forward. In order to use it, you need to paste the code in Command Prompt. Adjust to the code to 32 or 64 bit PC (depending on your computer) which is changing one line. Then adjust the input file format, output folder, and output format. My input format was .JPG, and output was .TXT.

The OCR doesn't allow you to do more than one image (page in that case) at once so the process becomes slow but gives the best result from all tested OCR.

## Reflection
You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below.

## Transcoding No. 2
### Subjective nature of language
These few tryouts conclude my wondering about how much the receiving of a viewer is influenced by language. First of all the receiver might not speak the language in which the source text is. Then the translation becomes an issue of importance. On the other hand, even if you speak the language there might be other problems. If it's not your first you might not understand completely. Even if it is your mother tongue maybe the words used are archaic, the grammar or construction is old. All of these layers impact the understanding of the text as a medium to keep information.

### Methods
I decided to use two methods to visualize that - using the image and using words, or rather their amount. This, in the end, became only a smaller sketch for the final transcoding.

### Tools

## Transcoding Tool
### Agata - little robot
There wasn't really a tool I developed for this. I rather simulated how the code could work manually. I would very gladly work on some OCR that would define images by words but the time and knowledge available didn't allow it.

## Reflection

## Transcoding No. 3
### Or rather a plan for it.
I believe that it is hard to judge all of the propaganda in the world, history. But I decided that I have an opinion about this propaganda book. I think that for this assignment I want to focus on the fact how mindlessly was this shared and the fact that it was UNTRUTH. This book seems to be mere ideas of the author rather than a statement of facts, nevertheless, it was shared and used as a marketing tool of the state. Funny enough the author was prosecuted by the state before for having and spreading the ideas.

### Methods
Game with 3 levels that symbolise:
- Empty promise of propaganda
- Language as a subjective form of safekeeping information
- A monument of an object - inaccessible and dead

### Tools
In order of use:
Unity
Cinema 4D
Blender
Mixamo
C# Scripting in Unity
Visual Studio

## Transcoding Tool
### Unity enviorment and C# Scripting
By generating three levels of the game in Unity I want to give a context and gain a platform to explain my findings and opinion about propaganda.
Also, to talk efficiently about mindless mass reproduction scripting is necessary. C# will be also needed for more trivial but needed functionalities - like "traveling" between levels.

### Aims
This final transcoding is supposed to be a place to gather all my thoughts on possible transcoding of the artifact. Its function is to be an item in the collection of the archive that represents not only my view on it but hopefully translates it in a new way which might be an interesting addition to the original copy.

### Methods
This iBy using scripting I want to generate 3 levels of the game that would touch upon issues I address at the beginning of explaining this transcoding.ncludes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.
